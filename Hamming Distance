The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.


Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def hammingDistance(self, x, y):
        z = x ^ y
        count = 0
        while z > 0:
            count += z & 1
            z >>= 1
            
        return count
